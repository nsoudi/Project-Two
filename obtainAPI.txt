API key sharing is prohibited therefor I have left it out of the program code.
You can obtain your own personal free weather data API from https://openweathermap.org/
It is necessary in order for the program to run successfully.
To get your API you need to navigate to https://openweathermap.org/ and create an account if you do not have one already.
After creating your account you can get a free key by clicking on your profile and navigating to "my API keys".
A key should have been automatically generated for you after having signed up but if it did not then click "generate".
Once your API key is generated, test to see if it is activated by navigating to "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=Omaha,us&appid=PASTEYOURKEYHERE"
If you get an error message that says "Invalid API KEY" you have to wait a little bit and try again until it becomes activated and you are able to see the raw data.
If you keep trying and keep getting the "Invalid API KEY" error, go back to https://openweathermap.org/ and generate a new account and try again.
After making sure that your key is active, return to app_gui.py and paste your key in the self.api_key variable on line 204 after "&appid=" that currently has place-holder of XxXxXxX.
Thank you.
